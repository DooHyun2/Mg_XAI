Jahn-Teller distortion SHAP graph 

The value X (0.3 to 1.0) represents the severity of structural distortion
Strong Negative Correlation: High distortion (>0.6) acts as a penalty factor, significantly dropping the voltage. 2. Role of Zn (Green Points): Zn-doped samples are clustered in the top-left region, proving that Zn effectively minimizes distortion and stabilizes the structure.

Impact of dopant amount on voltage

positive correlation: Increasing the dopant amount generally improves the voltage.
Superiority of Cobalt: Red dots (Co) consistently appear at the top, confirming 
that Cobalt is the most efficient element for maximizing voltage.
Minimum Requiremnet: To achieve a positive voltage gain (abobe the baseline),
a doping amount of at least  0.25 is required.
