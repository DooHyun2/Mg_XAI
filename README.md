Jahn-Teller distortion SHAP graph 

The value X (0.3 to 1.0) represents the severity of structural distortion

Strong Negative Correlation: High distortion (>0.6) acts as a penalty factor, significantly dropping the voltage. 

Role of Zn (Green Points): Zn-doped samples are clustered in the top-left region, proving that Zn effectively minimizes distortion and stabilizes the structure.

Impact of dopant amount on voltage

positive correlation: Increasing the dopant amount generally improves the voltage.

Superiority of Cobalt: Red dots (Co) consistently appear at the top, confirming 
that Cobalt is the most efficient element for maximizing voltage.

Minimum Requirement: To achieve a positive voltage gain (above the baseline),
a doping amount of at least  0.25 is required.

Global Feature Importance (SHAP Beeswarm)

Dominant Factor: Dopant amount is identified as the most critical determinant of battery voltage.

The wide distribution of points indicates it has the strongest influence on the model's output.

Positive impact: For dopant amount and dopant code,red dots are located on the right side, confirming that higher concentrations and specific elements boost voltage

Negative impact: Conversely, for sinter temperature and JT distortion,red dots appear on the left side. This implies that excessive heating and structural distortion negatively affect performance.
